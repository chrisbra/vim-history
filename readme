README for version 5.0 of Vim: Vi IMproved.

Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.

This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.

Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, Windows NT, Windows 95, Atari
MiNT, Macintosh, VMS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.  There are some
things included for the Archimedes, but it does not work yet.  Porting to
other systems should not be very difficult.

Documentation:
The best is to use ":help" in Vim.  If you don't have an executable (yet),
read doc/help.txt.  It contains pointers to the other documentation files.

"tutor/README" is a one hour training course for beginners.

Copying:
Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
encouraged to make a donation to orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
"doc/uganda.txt" for details.

If you include Vim on a CD-ROM, I would like to receive a copy.  Just so I
know which Vim distributions exists in the world (and to show off to my
friends :-)).

There are no restrictions on distributing an unmodified copy of Vim on a
CD-ROM or in any other way.  You are also allowed to include executables, made
from the unmodified Vim sources.

If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you must send the maintainer a
copy, including the source code.  Or make it available to the maintainer
through ftp; let him know where It can be found.  If the number of changes is
small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing the diffs will do.  The maintainer
preserves the right to include any changes in the official version of Vim.  It
is not allowed to distribute a modified version of Vim without making the
source code available to the maintainer.
The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar (Bram@vim.org).  If this changes, it
will be announced in appropriate places (most likely www.vim.org and
comp.editors).
It is not allowed to remove these restrictions from the distribution of the
Vim sources.

Compiling:
All stuff for compiling Vim is in the "src" directory.  See src/INSTALL for
instructions.
