==============================================================================

1. Filename Convention					*mac-filename*

You can use either the unix or mac path separator or a mix of both. In order
to determine if the specified filename is relative to the current folder or
absolute (i.e. relative to the "Desktop"), the following algorithm is used:

	If the path start by a "/", the path is abosute
	If the path start by a ":", the path is relative
	If the path doesn't start by neither a "/" nor ":",
	  and a ":" is found before a "/" then the path is absolute

>	e /HD/text
>	e HD:text
	Edit the file "text" of the disk "HD"
>	e :src:main.c
>	e src/main.c
	Edit the file "main.c" in the folder "src" in the current folder
>	e os_mac.c
	Edit the file "os_mac.c" in the current folder.

You can use the $VIM variable.

>	so $VIM:syntax:syntax.vim

==============================================================================

2. .vimrc and .vim files				*mac-vimfile*

The .vimrc, .gvimrc, *.vim files should always be saved in unix fileformat, th
dos format might be use but the mac format cannot be handled.

==============================================================================

3. Mac Lack						*mac-lack*

-The filenames containing both ":" and "/" are sometimes misinterpreted.
  (just re-execute the command)
-No filename expansion or wildcard yet
-No standard menu
-Can't use the command key
-No grow box to resize the window
-Scrollbar are not scrolling live, and  when only the arrorw or scroll area,
   a limmit of 32 line or pageis scrolled.
