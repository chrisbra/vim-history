INSTALLmac.txt - Installation of Vim on Macintosh

This file contains instructions for compiling Vim. If you already have an
executable version of Vim, you don't need this.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of how Vim can be compiled under MacOS, depending on
the version of MacOS, the compiler and the interface.

A. Supported compiler and environement

 1. CodeWarrior (pre-MacOS X)
 2. MPW (pre-MacOS X)
 3. Project Builder (MacOS X)
 4. Unix Compiler (MacOS X)

B. Supported user interface

 1. Original MacOS Toolbox   [Compile with A.1 and A.2]
 2. Carbon MacOS	     [Compile with A.3]
 3. X (Athena, GTK, Motif).  [Compile with A.4]
 4. Plain Text		     [Compile with A.4]

 NOTE: Sorry, Cocoa is not expected to be supported for now.

C. Supported "OS" style

 1. MacOS		     [Compile as B.1]
 2. MacOS X		     [Compile as B.2]
 3. BSD Unix		     [Compile as B.2, B.3 and B.4]

-----------------------------------------------------------

Special Consideration
---------------------

B.2: Compiling for Carbon

 Currently the Carbon version can only be compiled properly under MacOS X.
 The binary created in that way does'nt work under previous version.

B.3: Compiling for X

 You need to first install XFree86 and XDarwin.
 Please visit http://www.XDarwin.org

C.1: The MacOS version

 Both ':' and '/' supported as path separator.

C.2: The MacOS X version

 Only '/' supported as path separator.

C.3: The BSD Unix version

 Only '/' supported as path separator.
 Shell command can be invoked (:!)

-----------------------------------------------------------

A.1: Compiling with CodeWarior

 1. Expand the resource file:
   - ../src/os_mac.rsr.hqx (to produce ../src/gui_mac.rsrc)

 2. Expand the project file:
   - ../src/os_mac.sit.hqx (to produce ../src/vim.mcp)

 3. Open vim.mcp with CodeWarior

   This is a CodeWarior 9 project file. When using a newer version,
   you need to convert the file. you may also need to change some
   access path.

   NOTE: the current project file is old, you need to add a few files:
	 (ex_cmds2.c, fold.c, mbyte.c, move.c)

 4. Select the target PPC, 68k FAT (with/without debugger)

 5. Compile


A.2: Compiling with MPW.

 0. You will need a recent version of the MPW and the Universal Interfaces.
    You can get both at:
	ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Interfaces-Libraries/
	ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/
   For a Carbon version you will need a recent Carbon SDK as well.
   (When you have an older version already installed you not be able to
    compile a carbon version. Update "CreateMake" which is available at
    Apple.

 1. Expand the resource file:
   - ../src/os_mac.rsr.hqx (to produce ../src/gui_mac.rsrc)

 3. Double click on os_make.make, the MPW will now open in the correct
    folder and load the CreateVimMake script. Change to the Worksheet
    window. Type "os_mac.build" and hit Enter (not Return). A dialog box
    will appear. Select the target you want. (Vim-68k, Vim-ppc, Vim-carbon)

 4. Select "Build" from the menu (or type command-B). Type the program name
    into the dialog box.

A.3: Compiling with Project Builder.

 1. Expand the resource file:
   - ../src/os_mac.rsr.hqx (to produce ../src/gui_mac.rsrc)

 2. Open ../src/os_mac.pbproject with Project Builder

 3. Choose between C.2 and C.3

    In Target ... CCFLAGS use:

     -DMACOS_X
       if you want a normal MacOS X version (using os_mac.c)

     -DMACOS_X_UNIX
       if you want to use shell commands (using os_unix.c)
       NOTE: some functionality may be missing

 4. Hammer the build button in ;)


A.4: Using the unix compiler.

 From Terminal.app you can use "configure" and "make". Refer to INSTALL for
 full detail. The MacOS port is not involve here.


------------------------------------------------------

OLD FILE: SOME INFO MAY STILL BE USEFUL

NOTE: Users of more recent CodeWarrior version may have to reset the library
      path, and change the mch_delay in os_mac.c so the finalTick is unsigned.

Compilation instructions:

1. Visit the Vim ftp site (see ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/MIRRORS)
   and obtain the following five files:

   unix/vim-X.X-src1.tar.gz
   unix/vim-X.X-src2.tar.gz
   unix/vim-X.X-rt1.tar.gz
   unix/vim-X.X-rt2.tar.gz
   extra/vim-X.X-extra.tar.gz

   where X.X is the version number.

   NOTE: the language support is not yet supported

2. Expand the archives.

3. Apply patches if they exist.  (Patch files are found in the ftp
   site in the "patches" directory.)

4. Edit vim-X.X/src/feature.h for your preference.  (You can skip
   this, then you will get the default behavior as is documented,
   which should be fine for most people.)

   For example, if you want to add the FEAT_MBYTE feature, turn on
   #define FEAT_MBYTE

5. Expand the resource file:

   - vim-X.X/src/os_mac.rsr.hqx (to produce vim-X.X/src/gui_mac.rsrc)

6. If using CodeWarrior, expand the project file:

   - vim-X.X/src/os_mac.sit.hqx (to produce vim-X.X/src/vim.mcp)

   The latter file is the CodeWarrior project file to be used.

7. Launch CodeWarrior by double clicking vim.mcp.

8. Check additional files if you include non-standard features.

   For example, if you added the MULTI_BYTE feature, check
   Extras/mbyte.c in the project window.

9. Compile and you will obtain binaries: vimPPC, Vim 68k, and/or vimFAT.
