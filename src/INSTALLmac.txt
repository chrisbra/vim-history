INSTALLmac.txt - Installation of Vim on Macintosh

This file contains instructions for compiling Vim. If you already have an
executable version of Vim, you don't need this.

NOTE: Users of more recent CodeWarrior version may have to reset the library
      path, and change the mch_delay in os_mac.c so the finalTick is unsigned.

Compilation instructions:

1. Visit the Vim ftp site (see ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/MIRRORS)
   and obtain the following three files:

   unix/vim-X.X-src.tar.gz
   unix/vim-X.X-rt.tar.gz
   extra/vim-X.X-extra.tar.gz

   where X.X is the version number.

2. Expand the three archives.

3. Apply patches if they exist.  (Patch files are found in the ftp
   site in the "patches" directory.)

4. Edit vim-X.X/src/feature.h for your preference.  (You can skip
   this, then you will get the default behavior as is documented,
   which should be fine for most people.)

   For example, if you want to add the FEAT_MBYTE feature, turn on
   #define FEAT_MBYTE

5. Expand the following two files:

   - vim-X.X/src/os_mac.rsr.hqx (to produce vim-X.X/src/gui_mac.rsrc)
   - vim-X.X/src/os_mac.sit.hqx (to produce vim-X.X/src/vim.mcp)

   The latter file is the CodeWarrior project file to be used.

6. Launch CodeWarrior by double clicking vim.mcp.

7. Check additional files if you include non-standard features.

   For example, if you added the MULTI_BYTE feature, check
   Extras/multibyte.c in the project window.

8. Compile and you will obtain binaries: vimPPC, Vim 68k, and/or vimFAT.
