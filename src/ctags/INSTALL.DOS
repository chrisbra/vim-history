Simple makefiles are provided for a few environments.

    Makefile.amiga	For Amiga with Manx C
    Makefile.bcc	For Borland C/C++ on MSDOS
    Makefile.djg	For the Gnu GCC (DJGPP) compiler on MSDOS
    Makefile.os2	For OS/2
    Makefile.w32	For Win32 with Visual C++ or Borland C++

Make sure that your makefile defines the appropriate label for the host for
which you are compiling (i.e. AMIGA, MSDOS, OS2, or WIN32)
