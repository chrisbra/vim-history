Title:          Exuberant Ctags
Version:        3.3.3
Entered-date:   16DEC99
Description:    A better ctags with support for C, C++, Eiffel, Fortran and
                Java. It is capable of generating tags for all of the
                following language constructs:
		  C/C++:
		    macros; enumerators; functions; class, enum, struct, and
		    union names; class, struct, and union members; namespaces;
		    typedefs; variables (definitions and extern declarations);
		    function prototypes/declarations;
		  Eiffel:
		    classes; features; local entities
		  Fortran
		    block data; common blocks; entry points; functions;
		    interfaces; lables; modules; namelists; programs;
		    subroutines; derived types
		  Java:
		    classes; fields; interfaces; methods
		It is far less easily fooled by C code containing #if
		preprocessor conditional constructs. It can also be used to
		print out a list of selected objects found in source files.
		It can also produce Emacs-style TAGS files.
