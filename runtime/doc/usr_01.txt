==============================================================================
*01.1*  Two manuals

The Vim documentation consists of two parts:

1. The User manual
   Task oriented explanations, from simple to complex.  Reads like a book.

2. The Reference manual
   Precise description of how everything in Vim works.

There are links between the two parts, allowing the reader to quickly jump
between the description of an editing task and a precise explanation of the
commands and options used for it.

Hit CTRL-] to jump to a subject under the cursor.
Hit CTRL-O to jump back (can be repeated).


Most of the manuals assume that Vim has been properly installed.  If you
didn't do that yet, or if Vim doesn't run properly (e.g., files can't be found
or in the GUI the menus are not shown) first read the chapter on installation:
|usr_90.txt|.


The notation used in these manuals is explained here: |notation|

==============================================================================
*01.2*  Using the Vim tutor
							*tutor*
Instead of reading the text (boring!) you can use the vimtutor to learn your
first Vim commands.  This is a 30 minute tutorial that teaches the most basic
Vim functionality hands-on.

On Unix, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start it from the shell:
>
	vimtutor

This will make a copy of the tutor file, so that you can edit it without
the risk of damaging the original.

On non-Unix systems, you have to do a little work:

1. Copy the tutor file.  You can do this with Vim:
>
	vim -u NONE -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
<
   This will write the file "TUTORCOPY" in the current directory.

2. Edit the copied file with Vim:
>
	vim -u NONE -c "set nocp" TUTORCOPY
<
   The extra arguments make sure Vim is started in a good mood.

3. Delete the copied file:
>
	del TUTORCOPY
<

*01.3*  Copyright

The Vim user manual and reference manual are copyrighted by Bram Moolenaar.

Permission is granted to copy and distribute the manuals in unmodifed
electronic form in any way (on a CD-ROM, on the WWW, etc.).  This can be done
for free or not.

Permission is granted to print and distribute the unmodified manuals on paper
FOR FREE ONLY.  No charge for production, materials, transport, etc. can be
made.

Written permission from the author is required for distributing a paper copy
not for free.

Permission is granted to distribute the manuals as just mentioned but with
text added which is clearly marked as such.

People who contribute text to the manuals must agree with these conditions.

Rationale:
This limitation avoids the situation that somebody would bring out a book
with this text and charge money for it without paying the people who spent
their valuable time to write it.
I will allow publishing a book with this text if the publisher guarantees that
the profits go to the right place (to be judged by me).
It also disallows changing the text and pretending that I wrote it.
