Multi-language features				*multilang* *multi-lang*

1. Menus			|multilang-menus|
2. Scripts			|multilang-scripts|

{Vi does not have any of these features}

==============================================================================
1. Menus						*multilang-menus*

The default menus are in English.  To be able to use your local language, they
must be translated.  Normally this is automatically done for you if the $LANG
environment variable has been set and translations for the specified language
are available.  You don't need to do anything extra for this.

Note that if changes have been made to the menus after the translation was
done, some of the menus may be shown in English.  Please try contacting the
maintainer of the translation and ask him to update it.  You can find the
name and e-mail address of the translator in "$VIMRUNTIME/menu_<lang>.vim".

If you want to do your own translations, you can use the |:menutrans| command,
explained below.  For a language that has no translation yet, please consider
becoming the maintainer and make your translations available to all Vim users.
Send an e-mail to Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.

To add or override the menu translations, first source your translations and
then the "menu.vim" script (this may be skipped, since they are automatically
loaded when the GUI starts).  To avoid that a default translation is used, set
the "did_menutrans" variable to any value.  Example: >

	:source ~/vim/menu_xx_XX.ISO_8859-1.vim
	:let did_menutrans = 1
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
<

							*:menut* *:menutrans*
:menut[rans] clear	Clear all menu translations.

:menut[rans] {english} {mylang}
			Translate menu name {english} to {mylang}.  All
			special characters like "&" and "<Tab>" need to be
			included.  Spaces and dots need to be escaped with a
			backslash, just like in other |:menu| commands.


It is recommended to put the translations for one language in a Vim script.
Here is the start of "menu_de_de.iso_8859-1.vim": >

	" Menu Translations:	German
	" Translated By: 	Marcin Dalecki <dalecki@cs.net.pl>
	" Last Change:		2000 Jun 01

	menutrans clear

	" Help menu
	menutrans &Help			&Hilfe
	menutrans &Overview<Tab><F1>	&Überblick<Tab><F1>
	menutrans &How-to\ links	&How-to\ Index

Each part of a menu path is translated separately.  The result is that
"Help.Overview" will be translated to "Hilfe.Überblick".

To load this file automatically, give it the name "menu_$LANG.vim" and place
it in a "lang" directory in 'runtimepath'.  The first one found will be loaded
and the others ignore.  See "$VIMRUNTIME/lang" for examples.
You can select another language to be used by setting the 'langmenu' option.

==============================================================================
2. Scripts						*multilang-scripts*

In Vim scripts you can use the |v:lang| variable to get the current language
(locale).  The default value is "C" or comes from the $LANG environment
variable.

The following example shows how this variable is used in a simple way, to make
a message adapt to language preferences of the user, >

	:if v:lang =~ "de_DE"
	:  echo "Guten Morgen"
	:else
	:  echo "Good morning"
	:endif
<
						*:lan* *:lang* *:language*
:lan[guage]		Print the current language (aka locale).
			The current language can also be obtained with the
			|v:lang| variable. {not in Vi}

:lan[guage] {name}	Set the current language (aka locale) to {name}.
			This will make a difference for items that depend on
			the language (some messages, time and date format).
			Not fully supported yet.
			If this fails there will be an error message.  If it
			succeeds there is no message.  Example: >
				:language
				Current language: C
				:language de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:language
				Current language: de_DE.ISO_8859-1
