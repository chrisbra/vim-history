Network-Oriented File Transfers with Vim		*netrw* *network*
1. Network-Oriented File Transfer			|netrw-xfer|
2. Activation						|netrw-activate|
3. Ex Commands						|netrw-ex|
4. Variables						|netrw-var|

The functionality mentioned here is a |standard-plugin|.
This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.
You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_netrw" variable: >
	:let loaded_netrw = 1

{Vi does not have any of this}

==============================================================================
1. Network-Oriented File Transfer			*netrw-xfer*

Network-oriented file transfer under Vim is implemented by a VimL-based
script (<netrw.vim>).  It currently supports both reading and writing
across networks using rcp, scp, ftp, or ftp+<.netrc> as appropriate.
http is supported read-only.

    Reading				Writing			Uses ~
    --------------------------	---------------------------	----------
    * rcp://machine/path	* rcp://machine/path		rcp
    :Nread rcp://machine/path	:Nwrite rcp://machine/path		rcp

    * scp://machine/path	* scp://machine/path		scp
    :Nread scp://machine/path	:Nwrite scp://machine/path		scp

    * ftp://machine/path	* ftp://machine/path		ftp
    :Nread ftp://machine/path	:Nwrite ftp://machine/path		ftp+(**)
    :Nread machine path		:Nwrite machine path		ftp+.netrc
    :Nread machine uid pass path	:Nwrite machine uid pass path	ftp

    * http://machine/path					wget
    :Nread http://machine/path					wget

	(*) transparent file transfer: i.e. vim rcp://machine/path
					    :r	ftp://machine/path
					    :w	ftp://machine/path

	(**) if <.netrc> is present, it is assumed that it will
	     work with your ftp client.  Otherwise the script will
	     prompt for user-id and pasword.

Both the :Nread and the :Nwrite command can accept multiple filenames: >

	:Nread rcp://machine/path1 rcp://machine/path2


NETRC							*netrw-netrc*

The ftp transfers can make use of the optional <.netrc> file.  The typical
syntax for lines in a <.netrc> file is given as shown below. >

	machine {full machine name} login {user-id} password "{password}"
	default			    login {user-id} password "{password}"

Your ftp client must handle the use of <.netrc> on its own, but if the
<.netrc> file exists, an ftp transfer will not ask for the user-id or
password.

	Note:
	Since this file contains passwords, make very sure nobody else can
	read this file!  Most programs will refuse to use a .netrc that is
	readable for others.  Don't forget that the system administrator can
	still read the file!


PASSWORD						*netrw-passwd*

The script attempts to get passwords for ftp invisibly.  If the user has
explicitly specified both foreground and background colors for Normal
highlighting (see following example) >

  hi Normal      term=NONE cterm=NONE gui=NONE  start=<Esc>[m<Esc>[1;32;m
  \		 stop=t_me   guifg=green      guibg=navyblue  ctermfg=2

then the script can use those colors to keep the password request
"invisible".  See |netrw-uidpass| for how to change the password after
one has set it.


==============================================================================
2. Activation						*netrw-activate*

Network-oriented file transfers are available by default whenever
|'nocompatible'| mode is enabled.


TRANSPARENT FILE TRANSFER				*netrw-transparent*

Transparent file transfers occur whenever a regular file read or write
(invoked via an |:autocmd| for |BufReadCmd| or |BufWriteCmd| events) is
made.  Thus one may use files across networks as if they were local. >

	vim ftp://machine/path
	...
	:wq


==============================================================================
3. Ex Commands						*netrw-ex*

The usual read/write commands are supported.  There are also a couple of
additional commands available.

:[range]Nw			Write the specified lines to the current
				file as specified in b:netrw_lastfile.

:[range]Nw {netfile} [{netfile}]...
				Write the specified lines to the {netfile}.

:Nread				Read the specified lines into the current
				buffer from the file specified in
				b:netrw_lastfile.

:Nread {netfile} {netfile}...	Read the {netfile} after the current line.

							*netrw-uidpass*
:call NetUserPass()		If b:netrw_uid and b:netrw_passwd don't exist,
				this function query the user for them.

:call NetUserPass("userid")	This call will set the b:netrw_uid and, if
				the password doesn't exist, will query the
				user for it.

:call NetUserPass("userid","passwd")
				This call will set both the b:netrw_uid and
				b:netrw_passwd.  The user-id and password
				are used by ftp transfers.  One may
				effectively remove the user-id and password
				by using "" strings.


==============================================================================
4. Variables						*netrw-var*

The script <netrw.vim> uses several variables:

	netrw_uid			Holds current user-id for ftp.
	netrw_passwd		Holds current password for ftp.
	b:netrw_lastfile	Holds latest method/machine/path.

The script will also make use of the following variables internally,
albeit temporarily.

	s:netrw_method		Index indicating rcp/ftp+.netrc/ftp
	s:netrw_machine		Holds machine name parsed from input
	s:netrw_fname       Holds filename being accessed
