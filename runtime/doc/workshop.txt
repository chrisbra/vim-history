1. Introduction						*workshop-intro*

Sun's Visual WorkShop has an "Editor of Choice" feature designed to let users
debug using their favorite editors. For the 6.0 release we have added support
for gvim. A workshop debug session will have a debugging window and an editor
window (possibly others as well). The user can do many debugging operations
from the editor window, minimizing the need to switch from window to window.

The version of vim shipped with Sun Visual WorkShop 6 (also called Forte
Developer 6) is vim 5.3. The features in this release are much more reliable
than the vim/gvim shipped with Visual WorkShop. VWS users wishing to use vim
as their editor should compile these sources and install them in their
workshop release tree.

==============================================================================
2. Commands						*workshop-commands*

:ws[verb] verb			Pass the verb to the verb executor

Pass the verb to an workshop function which gathers some arguments and
sends the verb and data to workshop over an IPC connection.

==============================================================================
3. Compiling vim/gvim for Sun's Visual WorkShop		*workshop-compiling*

Compiling vim with USE_SUN_WORKSHOP turns on all compile time flags necessary
for building a vim to work with Visual WorkShop. The features required for VWS
have been built and tested using the Sun compilers from the VWS release. They
have not been built or tested using Gnu compilers. This does not mean the
features won't build and run if compiled with gcc, just that nothing is
guaranteed with gcc!
