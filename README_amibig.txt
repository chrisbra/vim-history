README_amibig.txt for version 5.7a of Vim: Vi IMproved.

See "README.txt" for general information about Vim.
See "README_ami.txt" for installation instructions for the Amiga.
These files are in the runtime archive (vim57rt.tgz).


The Amiga "big" archive contains a Vim executable for the Amiga which was
compiled with many features enabled.  Most people will be satisfied with the
normal executable in the main "bin" archive.  To reduce memory usage, the
normal version was compiled with some features disabled and this enhanced
version has been made available separately.

Among the extra features are:
- 'langmap' option
- 'righleft' option
- Farsi keyboard mapping
- Emacs tags support
- more builtin terminals
- Multi-byte support (not tested on the Amiga!)
