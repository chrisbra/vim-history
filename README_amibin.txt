README_amibin.txt for version 6.0o of Vim: Vi IMproved.

See "README.txt" for general information about Vim.
See "README_ami.txt" for installation instructions for the Amiga.
These files are in the runtime archive (vim60rt.tgz).


The Amiga "bin" archive contains the normal Vim executable for the Amiga.
There is also a "big" version with more features enabled.  Most people will be
satisfied with this normal executable.  To reduce memory usage, the normal
version was compiled with some features disabled and the enhanced version has
been made available separately in the "big" archive.

Among the disabled features are:
- 'langmap' option
- 'righleft' option
- Farsi keyboard mapping
- Emacs tags support
- more builtin terminals
- Multi-byte support (not tested on the Amiga!)
